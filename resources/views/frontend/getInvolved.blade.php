    Use a CSS preprocessor: You can use a CSS preprocessor such as Sass or Less to write your custom styles. These preprocessors allow you to use variables, nested selectors, and other advanced features.
It's recommended to use the first and third options as it makes it easy to maintain and update the code and also to keep your custom css separate from bootstrap css.
